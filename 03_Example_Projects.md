The quickest way to get started is by exploring the example apps:

**FuffrHello** - This is a minimal example that shows how to control two circles using the left and right sensor arrays or the case. This example uses a single touch interaction style for each side of the case.

**FuffrDots** - A minimal example that illustrates how to access multi touch data. For each touch point, a circle is drawn.

**FuffrMap** - Example app that show how to navigate Apple maps with the sensor case. Use right side finger to pan (scroll) across the map, and the left side finger to zoom the map with up/down movements.

**FuffrJS** - This example demonstrates how to interface with JavaScript and pass touch events to an app written in HTML/JS.
